The shower was wonderful, the air conditioning worked so well in the 90+ degree heat, and the bed was very comfy. The people working there (everyone whose names I forgot to get, but especially James and Dana) were great at giving me ideas of where to eat in the neighborhood. Reese was a wonderful bartender, as was Vicki(?). Very fun. The location is great. Walking distance from the Mall, and very near the Foggy Bottom —GWU metro stop which has 3 lines that can take you','Favorite hotel for traveling for business, comfortable, and clean! Great spot, walking and running distance to the monuments and local restaurants. Staff was so friendly, thank you for the great stay!'];
